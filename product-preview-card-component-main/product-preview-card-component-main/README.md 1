## Overview

### The challenge

Was able to design a website that:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Learnt how to make a website responsive using css with the use of media query.
learnt the use of flexbox
Learnt the use of positioning i.e absolute and relative position.


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  @media (min-width: 1021px) and (max-width: 1439px){
    .container{
      width: 100%;
      height: 1030px;
      background-color: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
      position: relative;
    
    }
```
this allowed the page to be responsive at all browser screen width starting from 1021px to 1439px making the page arranged and neat.

### Continued development

i would like to focus on the use of gridbox, learning bootstrap to fasten the web design, and the use of peudo positioning and animation in css
